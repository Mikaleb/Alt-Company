> So you want to create a company? Do you need resources? You'd like for your company (or even your own) data to not be deleted by FAANG randomly?

## Alt-Company

The content goal is to actively show the alternatives of proprietary solutions that can get you out of their systems when they want. It's not exhaustive, and you might see that these solutions here as they are widely used and trustworthy in their industries.

### Adding content

The route /admin/new is built for you to have a little visual editor that output a ready to use Markdown file,

you need to create it in your project folder under your language, let's say `/content/en/myNewPage.md` .

> It's a temporary solution, when nuxt/content will be able to show us how to do that via their api.

### Editing content

You can double click on an article to edit the markdown directly.
_TODO : add an edit button_
