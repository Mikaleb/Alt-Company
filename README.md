> A curated resources collection you'd like for your company data (heck even your own datas) to not be deleted by a third-party / FAANG randomly

## Alt-Company

The content goal is to actively show the alternatives of proprietary solutions that can get you out of their systems when they want. It's not exhaustive, and you might see that these solutions here as they are widely used and trustworthy in their industries.

### Alt-Movement

This repository is part of the 'Alt Movement', a movement I created to empower everyone to be safe from themselves and others.
Each repository is a curated collection of resources for a certain goal, not by subject. For that, you can always check the amazing work of [Awesome's community](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
Soon : Alt-Person, Alt-Citizen, Alt-Travel, Alt-Housing, etc ...

### Adding content

The route /admin/new is built for you to have a little visual editor that output a ready to use Markdown file,
you need to create it in your project folder under your language, let's say `/content/en/myNewPage.md` .

> It's a temporary solution, when [nuxt/content](https://github.com/nuxt/content) will be able to show us how to do that via their api.

### Editing content

You can double click on an article to edit the markdown directly.

_TODO : add an edit button_
