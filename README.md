# Alt-Company

The content goal is to actively show the alternatives of proprietary solutions that can get you out of their systems when they want. It's not exhaustive, and you might see that these solutions here as they are widely used and trustworthy in their industries.

## Backup data

- [BackBlaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/buy.htm) ($6 / mois - $60 / an)

## CRM

When it comes to managing your customers, making invoices, quotes, keeping information up to date and all that frivolity, you can count on good old CRM: Customer Relation Management.
Clearly, this is a suite of tools that will allow you to do all that and possibly much more!

- [https://akaunting.com/](https://akaunting.com/) Software dedicated to accounting, does not fall too much into the CRM category but allows you to manage your account from A to Z.
- [https://framalibre.org/content/odoo-community-edition](https://framalibre.org/content/odoo-community-edition) Odoo Community Edition, the ultimate CRM.

## Payroll

You have to be able to pay your employee (s) but it will be just as wise to avoid taking out the checkbook or giving payroll information to external boxes, here's how:

- [https://www.openconcerto.org/fr/index.html](https://www.openconcerto.org/fr/index.html) Open Concerto, a good solution that has been scattered a bit like CRM but which remains a good reference in terms of payroll management.
- [https://framalibre.org/content/odoo-community-edition](https://framalibre.org/content/odoo-community-edition) Odoo, via the OpenPAIES extension which is a treat to use.

## Project Management

- [Github](https//github.com) obviously
- [Gitlab](https//gitlab.com) can be self-host

## Video meeting

The Zoom alternatives

- [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/)
- [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/)
- [Rocket Chat](https://rocket.chat/pricing/)
