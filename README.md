# alt-company

So you want to create a company? Do you need resources ? You'd like for your company (or even your own) data to not be deleted by FAANG randomly?
If you are a fervent free software/privacy enthusiast or if you just like to not have your google account wiped out for no reason, you're in the right place.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
